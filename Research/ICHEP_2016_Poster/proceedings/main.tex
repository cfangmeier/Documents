\abstract{\
A silicon-strip sensor based particle telescope is being developed to
aid in the characterization of next-generation silicon-pixel detectors for
the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
This telescope is expected to enable sub-micron feature studies of prototype
detectors by combining 25-{\micron} pitch strip detectors with a very low noise
read out system. Additionally, this telescope improves upon previous iterations
by deploying a parallel read out scheme to increase the maximum trigger rate by
a factor of 16.

\section{Introduction}

The innermost element of the CMS detector at the LHC is the silicon pixel
tracker. The current version of the tracker has performed well and been
critical to the physics program of CMS. The High Luminosity LHC upgrade of CMS
will replace the entire silicon tracking system.  As part of this upgrade, a
new section of the pixel tracker is proposed to be added in the so-called
``very-forward'' ($\eta\sim4$) region of the detector. Because the particles in
this region are traveling almost parallel to the magnetic field of the
detector, enhanced $\phi$ sensitivity is required to accurately measure track
curvature, a critical measurement for finding particle momentum and charge.
Therefore, the proposed detector will reshape the standard
$100\times150\micron$ pixels to be more sensitive in $\phi$, sacrificing
precision in $\rho$. A telescope is being developed with its primary purpose to
characterize different pixel geometries, however a variety of studies could be
enabled by the its use.

The telescope operates by using eight layers of silicon-strip sensors, with the
prototype pixel detector placed in the center with four layers on each side. A beam of
charged particles is directed to pass through both the strip
sensors and the prototype pixel sensors.  Measurements from the telescope are
taken to reconstruct individual particle tracks. These tracks are then compared
to data collected from the pixel sensor to characterize its performance.

\section{Hardware}
The telescope has been designed around a specific silicon-strip sensor and
accompanying read out chip, both of which were originally developed for the H1
vertex detector at HERA~\cite{Hilgers2001}. The strip sensor contains 512 strips
with $25\micron$ pitch. The read out chip is the {\bf Analog Pipeline Chip
  \-- 128} (APC).  Each APC can read 128 strips so four chips are required to read a
single strip sensor. The APC operates an integrating pre-amplifier that
collects charge from a single sensor strip and keeps a 32-sample history of the
output of that pre-amplifier. When a trigger is received from, for example, a
scintillation detector indicating a particle has passed through the telescope,
the appropriate sample is chosen from the 32-sample history based on the
calibrated trigger latency and the selected samples from all 128 channels of
the APC are serialized to its output. An illustration of what the signal coming
from a single APC may look like is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:readout}.

      which CAT-5 cables are plugged to transmit the signals to the DAQ board.}

      motherboards, and an Opal-Kelly FPGA integration module (center) to
      orchestrate the operation of the telescope.}

\end{figure}

The strip sensor and four APC are mounted onto a sensor-card along
with four buffer amplifiers that compensate for the relatively weak output of
the APC and generate a more robust differential signal with the proper output
impedance for driving CAT-5 cables ($100\si{\ohm}$). Four sensor-cards are
plugged into a motherboard (Fig.~\ref{fig:hardware:motherboard}) which provides mechanical support for the
sensor-cards and routes electrical signals between the sensor cards and the I/O
ports.

The signals from the two motherboards that constitute the telescope are routed
to the data acquisition (DAQ) board (Fig.~\ref{fig:hardware:daq}). The DAQ board contains eight
40\si{\mega\hertz} 10-bit ADCs with four channels each, giving a total of 32
digitization channels. The DAQ board also contains circuitry for supplying the
bias voltage for the strip detectors, and LEMO connectors for supplying an
external trigger and clock signal. Digital logic is implemented via an Opal
Kelly FPGA integration module which features an Altera Cyclone IV FPGA, 128MB
of RAM, and a Super-Speed USB link for data transfer.

\section{Read out Scheme}
The read out scheme has been designed to maximize the data throughput in terms
of analog strip-sample values per second. This has been done in an effort to
minimize dead time since the APC cannot take data during read out. Therefore,
any data from beam that passes through the telescope during read out is lost.
Fig.~\ref{fig:readout} illustrates the read out scheme. Roughly speaking, the
read out happens in three stages. The first stage is handled by the electronics
in and near the beam. It is here that the passage of a charged particle is
converted to an electronic pulse by the strip sensor and the height of that
pulse is recorded by the APC. The APC then serializes pulse heights from many
channels to the cables exiting the beam region.

The signals from the telescope are then routed to the DAQ board where they are
digitized and fed into an FPGA. The FPGA contains firmware that is responsible
for dropping strip readings with pulse-heights below the set threshold and
grouping the remaining strips into ``hit'' objects. These hit objects, along
with their associated trigger id, are then pushed to a connected PC via a USB
link to be saved to disk.

Offline analysis software then uses this data to identify the individual tracks
of particles passing through the telescope. Detector alignment studies will
also be critical to measuring the position of the strip sensors to micron
precision. Finally, the tracks can be interpolated to the impact point with the
prototype pixel detector and used to measure its properties.

\section{Projected Telescope Performance}
The performance of the telescope can be quantified in two ways: the
precision with which individual particle trajectories can be measured, and
the rate at which data can be collected. 

The measurement precision of particle tracks depends on the number of detector
layers and the single hit precision. The telescope consists of eight
silicon-strip sensor layers with $25\micron$ pitch. For strip sensors
with charge sharing the single hit precision can be approximated by the
pitch divided by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the read out system.
The expected SNR of the telescope is 25~\cite{Ryser2013}. This yields a single-hit precision of
$\approx1\micron$. This single-hit precision combined with two measurements in
each dimension on each side of the prototype sensor should give sub-micron
track localization at the point of impact with the prototype sensor.

The data collection rate for the telescope is primarily limited by the speed
data can be transferred from the APC to the DAQ board. This is
because many typical test-beam facilities have beam rates on the order of
\si{\mega\hertz} while the telescope can only be triggered at
$\approx15\si{\kilo\hertz}$. The trigger rate can be improved somewhat by
optimizing the read out electronics using well established techniques such as
the placement of buffer amplifiers near the APC to reduce the rise-time of
signals as they propagate along the cables to the DAQ board, as well as the use
of differential signaling on these same cables to reduce electro-magnetic
interference. It is because of this limitation that the decision was made to
read out every APC in parallel, in contrast with previous incarnations of this
telescope which serialized sixteen APC~\cite{Turner2012}. This alone will yield
a 16-fold decrease in read out time.
